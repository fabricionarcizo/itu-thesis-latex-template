\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap:conclusions}
\lettrine[lines=3]{T}{he} conclusions chapter serves as the final summary and reflection of your work. It highlights the key contributions of your thesis and discusses potential avenues for future research. This chapter is crucial as it ties together all your findings and reinforces the significance of your work in the broader context of your field.

\section{Contributions of this Thesis}
\noindent In this section, you should clearly articulate the specific contributions your work has made to the field. This is your opportunity to summarize the original insights, developments, or innovations your thesis has provided. Focus on:

    \item \textbf{Key Achievements:} Highlight the major findings or results of your study. Ensure you connect them to the objectives outlined in your introduction.
    \item \textbf{Significance:} Explain why these contributions are important and how they address gaps or challenges identified in the literature.
    \item \textbf{Scope of Impact:} Discuss how your work may influence future research, applications, or industry practices.
\end{enumerate}

Write in a confident tone and avoid repeating detailed results already presented in the earlier chapters. Instead, provide a concise overview that emphasizes the importance of your work.

\section{Future Work}
This section reflects on the limitations of your study and proposes directions for future research. A thoughtful discussion here demonstrates your awareness of the boundaries of your work and your vision for advancing the field. Include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Unresolved Questions:} Identify areas where additional research is needed to build on your findings;
    \item \textbf{New Opportunities:} Suggest innovative applications or extensions of your work that were beyond the scope of your thesis; and
    \item \textbf{Practical Suggestions:} Provide actionable ideas for researchers or practitioners interested in exploring the topics further.
\end{enumerate}

Be honest about the limitations of your work and frame them as opportunities for future exploration. This demonstrates maturity in your understanding of the research process and contributes to a constructive academic dialogue.
