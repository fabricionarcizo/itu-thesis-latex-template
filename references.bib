  abstract  = {During the development of a scientific research in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) it is needful to identify, read, analyze and interpret relevant publications about a given theme or subject. Such a task usually results in large sets of bibliographical data. As a consequence, they must be put together in a single document, with the aim of making easy to assess the strength of the evidence of interest. Nonetheless, this is not an easy task to accomplish. Systematic reviews (SR) come to fulfill this need, by providing comprehensive, reliable, and unbiased summaries of a research on a single topic. Additionally, SR bring together large numbers of individual studies in a single report, provides the best evidence for decision making, and also help determine future research needs.},

  Abstract                 = {Eye tracking is an active multidisciplinary research field, which has shown great progress in the last decades. Eye tracking is the process of monitoring eye movements in order to determine the point of gaze or to analyze motion patterns of an eye relative to the head or the environment. This process provides essential information to tasks such as face detection, usability testing, biometric identification, human behavior studies and human-computer interaction, among others. The term textit{remote} is used whenever the eye tracker components do not have any physical contact with the user's body. In general, highly accurate commercial eye trackers are expensive. However, nowadays it is possible to develop low-cost remote eye tracking systems with off-the-shelf hardware components. By this perspective, an overview of eye tracking technologies and applications is given in this paper, and the state-of-the-art work in the field is discussed as well. Moreover, hardware components and underlying computer vision processes are also presented in this paper.},

O hardware do Dispositivo Rastreador foi montado artesanalmente, fixando o Dispositivo de Captura de V\'ideo no visor direito de um \'oculos de prote\c{c}\~ao industrial. Em conjunto com o hardware, foram desenvolvidos softwares para permitir que Portadores de Necessidades Especiais emulem o uso dos dispositivos de entrada padr\~ao do computador (mouse e teclado) atrav\'es dos movimentos oculares. Os principais sistemas criados foram: o ``Mouse \'Optico Ocular'' e o ``Teclado \'Optico Ocular''.

  abstract  = {Preprocessor directives (#ifdefs) are often used to implement compile-time variability, despite the critique that they increase complexity, hamper maintainability, and impair code comprehensibility. Previous studies have shown that the time of bug finding increases linearly with variability. However, little is known about the cognitive process of debugging programs with variability. We carry out an experiment to understand how developers debug programs with variability. We ask developers to debug programs with and without variability, while recording their eye movements using an eye tracker. The results indicate that debugging time increases for code fragments containing variability. Interestingly, debugging time also seems to increase for code fragments without variability in the proximity of fragments that do contain variability. The presence of variability correlates with increase in the number of gaze transitions between definitions and usages for fields and methods. Variability also appears to prolong the "initial scan" of the entire program that most developers initiate debugging with.},

  abstract    = {This Ph.D. thesis is about using available information known from the problem at hand (aka \textit{priors}), with the aim to enhance the performance of head-mounted eye trackers. Prior information is used for eye tracking scenarios in different sports disciplines to improve the accuracy and robustness of gaze estimation in critical situations. This thesis also explores off-the-shelf hardware to build flexible and adaptable eye trackers that exploit the constraints revealed for specific sports settings. Several eye tracking methods are presented, in which the use of priors plays the leading role. The compensation models proposed in this thesis ranging from solving geometrical constraints of head-mounted eye trackers to eye feature detection in challenging environment lighting conditions. The experiments focused on different sports disciplines to collect and analyze eye tracking data involving elite athletes during the daily training sessions of shooting and kayak as well as some laboratory experiments. The results of the experiments showed that the use of priors is very promising to the field of eye tracking, such as (i) using the distance between the athlete and the observed target as priors, to reduce the influence of parallax error in 80.59\%; (ii) using the 3D angles from the athlete's head as priors, to reduce the influence of head rotation in 86.41\%; (iii) using the geometric relation of human ocular system as priors, to make eye tracking more robust to eye feature noise, among others. Using priors in different steps of an eye tracking system has a general and substantial impact on eye trackers in general. While the focus of this thesis is in the use of eye tracking in sports, it is evident that progress achieved within this project on gaze estimation for sports activities has a direct impact on other areas that use eye tracking as well.},

Several factors can negatively influence gaze estimation methods when building a commercial or off-the-shelf eye tracker device, including the eye-camera location in uncalibrated setups. Our experiments show that the eye-camera location combined with the non-coplanarity of the eye plane deforms the eye feature distribution when the eye-camera is far from the eye�s optical axis. This paper proposes geometric transformation methods to reshape the eye feature distribution based on the virtual alignment of the eye-camera in the center of the eye�s optical axis. The data analysis uses eye-tracking data from a simulated environment and an experiment with 83 volunteer participants (55 males and 28 females). We evaluate the improvements achieved with the proposed methods using Gaussian analysis, which defines a range for high-accuracy gaze estimation between -0.54$^\circ$ and 0.5$^\circ$. Compared to traditional polynomial-based and homography-based gaze estimation methods, the proposed methods increase the number of gaze estimations in the high-accuracy range.},
